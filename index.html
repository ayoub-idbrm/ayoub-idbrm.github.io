    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I’m a developer with a strong curiosity for how things work under the hood, shaped by my journey in Capture The Flag (CTF) 
        competitions—especially in reverse engineering. Through CTFs, I learned to analyze binaries, break down complex logic, and 
        think like both a defender and an attacker, which sharpened my problem-solving and low-level reasoning skills. In parallel,
         I’ve been building myself as a developer, focusing on writing clean, maintainable code and understanding software architecture 
         from the ground up. This mix of security mindset and development discipline allows me to approach problems analytically, build 
         robust solutions, and continuously push my technical limits.

    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Libft</strong> – A custom library of standard C functions that I built from scratch.
            This project strengthened my understanding of low-level programming, memory management, and reusable code structures. </li>
        <li><strong>ft_printf</strong> – A reimplementation of the standard printf function in C. It helped me master variadic functions,
            format specifiers, and string manipulation while reinforcing precision and attention to detail.</li>
        <li><strong>Get Next Line</strong> – A function that reads a file descriptor line by line,
            handling memory efficiently and supporting multiple file descriptors. This project taught me advanced file handling and dynamic memory management in C.</li>
        <li><strong>Born To Be Root</strong> – A hands-on Linux project focused on system administration, networking, and security.
            I automated server configurations and learned to manage users, permissions, and services securely.</li>
        <li><strong>Push Swap</strong> – An algorithmic project where I implemented a program to sort numbers
            using limited stack operations. It improved my problem-solving, algorithmic thinking, and optimization skills.</li>
    </ul>
